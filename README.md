# weather-website
This website was built using third-party API's and server-side API's as well as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. HTML was used to create a basic structure for the data to be displayed. CSS was then used to style it. The third-party API bootstrap was used to create a form where the user could enter in the city name. OpenWeatherMap API was used to call the daily and 5 day forecast from. JavaScript was used to parse through the received information and display it on the page. When a city was entered, a button with it's name was generated to keep track of previous cities called.
